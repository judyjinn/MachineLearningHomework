# MachineLearningHomework

When auditing Machine Learning in 2015 I also did as many of the homework sets as I could. This repository contains some of the homework assignments.

`Homework1.py` Using support vector machines with scikit-learn to sort [handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and also practicing cross validation using k-fold methods to find the best C parameter.

`Homework3.py` Uses a gaussian classifier to classify the same MNIST handwritten digit set

`Homework4.py` Uses a linear regression to classify song types by the year they were produced. A logistic regression is then used on the MNIST handwritten digits.

# MachineLearningHomework

When auditing Machine Learning in 2015 I also did as many of the homework sets as I could. This repository contains some of the homework assignments. I also over-commented to ensure I remembered what I did later... now I have better commenting practices.

`Homework1.py` Using support vector machines with scikit-learn to sort [handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and also practicing cross validation using k-fold methods to find the best C parameter.

`Homework3.py` Uses a gaussian classifier to classify the same MNIST handwritten digit set

`Homework4.py` Uses a linear regression to [classify songs](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YearPredictionMSD) by the year they were produced. A logistic regression is then used on an email set `spam.mat` to classify spam emails from non spam emails
